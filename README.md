Welcome to my machine learning project on the Iris dataset! In this project, we will explore the famous Iris dataset and build a classifier to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their measurements.

## Description

The Iris dataset is a commonly used dataset in machine learning and statistics. It consists of 150 samples of Iris flowers, with each sample containing four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a corresponding species label (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica). The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying the species of Iris flowers based on their measurements.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/OwqanDaisy/iris-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd iris-project
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset

The Iris dataset can be found in the `data/iris.csv` file. This file includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and the corresponding species label for each sample.

## Usage

To run the project and train the model, execute the following command:
```
python train_model.py
```

This command will split the dataset into training and testing sets, train the machine learning model, and evaluate its performance on the testing set.

## Results

After running the project, you will see the accuracy of the trained model displayed on the console. Additionally, the model will be saved in the `model/` directory as a serialized object for future use.
